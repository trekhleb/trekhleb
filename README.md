### Hi there!

I'm Oleksii. I work as a full-time software engineer at Uber. In my spare time I do open-sourcing _(normally it is about 1-2 hours in the morning before the work)_.

Most of my open-source 🚀 [projects](https://trekhleb.dev/projects/) below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing -  **to help people learn** 📚. You may use these projects to learn about _algorithms in JavaScript_ and get prepared for _technical interviews_, or to learn _Python_ syntax and start experimenting with _machine learning algorithms_ and math behind them, etc.

There are also [other projects](https://trekhleb.dev/projects/) that I've developed for fun but that you might find useful, like ✍🏻 [okso.app](https://okso.app/) online drawing app.

I also write 📝 [articles](https://trekhleb.dev/blog/) about life, web-development and machine learning.
